# serialism

I was reading Karlheinz Stockhausen's [How Time Passes](https://sites.evergreen.edu/thewordintheear-fall/wp-content/uploads/sites/316/2014/09/HowTimePasses.pdf) (1957) in *Die Reihe*. So I made this.

## Instuctions

The idea is that each note, clock division, and amplitude is used once per bar. Silly constrain but oh well let's explore it.

- <kbd>E1</kbd> select a serie
- <kbd>E2</kbd> and <kbd>E3</kbd> select two items
- <kbd>K2</kbd> swap them
- <kbd>K3</kbd> shuffle the serie
- <kbd>K1+K2</kbd> reverse the serie
- <kbd>K1+K3</kbd> invert the serie

## Requirements

- norns
- MIDI device for output

## Roadmap

- [ ] Maybe gamepad HID composing? Somebody gave me one the other day.
- [ ] Seems like just the thing for n.b.
- [ ] crow interface
