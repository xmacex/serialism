# serialism

I was reading Karlheinz Stockhausen's *How Time Passes By* (1957) in Die
Reihe. So I made this.

## Instuctions

The idea is that each note, clock division, and amplitude is used once per bar. Silly constrain but oh well let's explore it.

- K2 shuffle notes
- K3 shuffle divisions
- E2 transpose ↑/↓

## Requirements

- norns
- MIDI device for output

## Roadmap

- [ ] Maybe gamepad HID composing? Somebody gave me one the other day.
